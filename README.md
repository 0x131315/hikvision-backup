# hikvision-backup

Simple tool to back up videos from Hikvision cameras.  
Created as an MVP pet project for private use.

### üöÄ Easy to Use ‚Äî Set and Forget

Just configure the environment variables, run the script ‚Äî and you're done.  
It handles retries, verifies file integrity, and keeps your archive up to date automatically.

Ideal for automation: run it as a cron job, systemd service, or background task.

### How It Works

The script performs the following steps to ensure all camera videos are downloaded reliably:

#### üîÅ Retry Logic
- Retries up to **3 times** in case of:
    - Authentication errors
    - Camera returning **HTTP 500** errors

#### üì∑ Video Scanning
- Scans the camera for videos from the last `SCAN_LAST_DAYS` days
- For each video:
    - Uses the **start date** as the filename
    - Uses the **video size** as the expected file size

#### üìÅ Local File Check
- For each video file in `DOWNLOAD_DIR`:
    - **Check if the file exists**
    - **Verify the file size**
        - If the file is too small (incomplete or corrupted):
            - Delete the local file
            - Re-download the video

#### ‚¨áÔ∏è Video Download
- Downloads all new or missing videos
- Ensures files are complete and match the expected size
